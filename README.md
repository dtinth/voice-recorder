# voice-recorder

**A simple web-based voice recorder.** This web app lets you record your voice and save it as an WAV file:

- **Automatic noise suppression** powered by [WebRTCâ€™s API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSettings/noiseSuppression).

- **Drag out WAV file from the browser.** After recording you can drag out an WAV file out to your Desktop!
